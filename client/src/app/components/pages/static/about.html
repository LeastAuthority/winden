<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Winden is a free web application that allows secure, fast, and easy transfer
  files between devices in real-time. Winden is identity-free, meaning that
  senders and receivers don’t need to know each other’s identity to use it, or
  to reveal their identity to us. We do not require people to sign up or log in
  and we cannot access any files you send, as they are end-to-end encrypted.
  Files are never stored on our servers and transfers happen in real-time. While
  these aspects ensure the app is more private and secure, it means that both
  the sender and receiver need to be online at the same time.

  Based on the
  <a href="https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/"> Magic Wormhole protocol </a>
  , Winden was developed to scale the protocol without compromising its security
  and make it ready for web-usage. Part of this work was funded by the European
  Union’s
  <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a> program
  (NGI_Trust).

  Winden is a product of Least Authority, based in Berlin, Germany. Least
  Authority creates freedom-compatible technologies, works on decentralized
  systems (Web3), and provides security consulting services for a wide range of
  blockchain ecosystems and Web3 projects.
</p>
<p>
  The name Least Authority is derived from “the principle of least authority”
  (PoLA) — also known in information security as “the principle of least
  privilege” or “the principle of minimal privilege” — a security best practice
  requiring system components to only have the privilege necessary to complete
  their intended function and not more.
