<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Winden is a free web application for secure, fast, and easy file transfers
  between devices in real-time. Winden is identity-free, meaning that senders
  and receivers don’t need to know each other’s identity to use it, or to reveal
  their identity to us.
</p>
<p>
  We do not require people to sign up or log in and we cannot access any files
  you send, as they are end-to-end encrypted. Files are never stored on our
  servers and transfers happen in real-time. While these aspects ensure the app
  is more private and secure, it means that both the sender and receiver need to
  be online at the same time.

  Based on the
  <a href="https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/">
    Magic Wormhole protocol <i class="ti ti-external-link"></i
  ></a>
  , Winden was developed to scale the protocol without compromising its security
  and make it ready for web-usage. Part of this work was funded by the European
  Union’s
  <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/"
    >Next Generation Internet <i class="ti ti-external-link"></i

  Winden is a product of Least Authority, based in Berlin, Germany. Least
  Authority creates freedom-compatible technologies, works on decentralized
  systems (Web3), and provides security consulting services for a wide range of
  blockchain ecosystems and Web3 projects.
</p>
<p>
  The name Least Authority is derived from “the principle of least authority”
  (PoLA) — also known in information security as “the principle of least
  privilege” or “the principle of minimal privilege” — a security best practice
  requiring system components to only have the privilege necessary to complete
  their intended function and not more.
