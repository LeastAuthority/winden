<h1>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS (the "Terms")</h1>
<small>Last updated: September 27, 2022</small>
<br />
<br />
<p>
  Thank you for choosing our service which allows people to transfer data
  ("Service"). The Service is provided by Least Authority TFA GmbH, Thaerstraße
  28a, 10249 Berlin (<b>"Least Authority"</b>, <b>"we"</b> or <b>"us"</b> or
  <b>"our"</b>). By using the Service, you conclude a binding agreement with us
  under the following terms and conditions. The Terms shall apply in the version
  current at the time of the first use of the Service as a framework agreement
  (§ 305 (3) of the German Civil Code (BGB)) and also to subsequent uses of the
  Service by the same person without having to refer to them again:
</p>
<br />
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Scope of the Service</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The Service allows a person (<b>"Sender"</b>) to transfer data through
        the Service to another person (<b>"Receiver"</b>). For this purpose, we
        provide the Sender with a one-time code or other means to enable another
        person’s access to the content. The Sender may forward these means to
        the Receiver using any method the Sender deems appropriate for this
        purpose. We do not forward the means to the Receiver as part of our
        Service. The Receiver may use the means to establish a one-time transfer
        of the content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Both Sender and/or Receiver can use the Service without prior
        registration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Both sending and receiving data through the Service is a use of the
        Service. You shall only use the Service in accordance with these Terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        We provide the Service "as is" and free of charge. These Terms do not
        grant you any right or claim with respect to any form, functionality
        and/or availability of the Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        We especially reserve the right to alter, amend, suspend, or discontinue
        the Service at any time at our own discretion.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is technically possible to connect and use the backend servers used
        by Winden with applications other than Winden. By using these servers
        with other applications, you agree to be bound to these same Terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        We offer our services in support of international human rights,
        including the rights to freedom of expression and privacy.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Own responsibility</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        You are fully and solely responsible for the content that you transfer
        via our Service and the consequences of such transfer.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the content that you transfer through the Service is subject to
        potential rights of third parties, you hereby undertake to ensure that
        you are authorized to transfer and use the content and that you do not
        infringe any third party rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are a Sender, you must ensure that the transfer of content is in
        compliance with applicable law. As a Sender you especially ensure that
        the transfer complies with all applicable export control regulations.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Prohibition of misuse</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Misusing the Service or helping others to do so is strictly prohibited.
        You therefore agree that you will not use the Service in any harmful or
        malicious way. In particular, but not exclusively, you shall not do one
        of the following:
        <ol>
          <li>transferring content that violates applicable law;</li>
          <li>
            transferring content that depict the sexual exploitation of children
            and adolescents, extreme violence, promotion of terrorist acts,, as
            well as hatred or discrimination of persons or groups of persons;
          </li>
          <li>
            disrupting the Service or interfering with other users, e.g. by
            using viruses or any other forms of attacks;
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Blocking or limiting</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        We hereby expressly reserve the right to block or limit access to the
        Service for good cause at any time and without prior notice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Good cause for blocking or limiting access to the Service shall in
        particular be given in case of misuse of the Service and/or other
        violations of these Terms.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>No Responsibility of Last Authority for user content</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        If you transfer/receive content through the Service, this is technically
        facilitated by a stream of data. We do not store any content at our
        servers or systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        You explicitly acknowledge that it is an inherent part of our Service
        that we do not and cannot monitor or control the data content that is
        transferred via the Service to you or other users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only the Sender has knowledge of the nature and type of content that the
        Sender transfers via our Service. If a Sender forwards to you means for
        receiving content and you are unsure about the nature and/or type of
        this content, you may refrain from receiving it at your own discretion.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you receive content through the Service, it is at your own risk. We
        do not bear any responsibility for the content which you receive through
        the Service.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Liability (<i>Haftung</i>)</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        We are only liable to you as stated hereinafter.
        <ol>
          <li>
            We are liable for damages which we or our vicarious agents
            (<i>Erfüllungsgehilfen</i>) caused intentionally and grossly
            negligent or which we caused by violating a guarantee undertaken by
            us.
          </li>
          <li>
            We are further liable for damages which we caused by a slightly
            negligent breach of an essential obligation necessary for the
            performance of these Terms (<i>wesentliche Vertragspflichten</i>).
            In this case, our liability shall be limited to typical and
            foreseeable damages.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        A limitation period (<i>Verjährungsfrist</i>) of one year applies to any
        liability claims against us. This begins at the end of the year in which
        the claim arose and you became aware or should have become aware of the
        circumstances giving rise to the claim.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any limitation of our liability does not apply in the case of gross
        negligence and intent, liability under the Product Liability Act
        (<i>Produkthaftungsgesetz</i>) or in the case of damages to the life,
        body and health of natural persons.
      </li>
      <li>
        You agree that you shall be liable to us in accordance with the
        provisions of statutory law.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Term; Termination</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The Terms apply for each one-time use of the Service. Our agreement for
        the use of the Service terminates automatically when the transfer of
        content is completed or fails.
      </li>
      <li>
        For clarity: If you commence another use of the Service, you are again
        bound by the Terms.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Open Source Software</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        You acknowledge that the software which we use to provide the Service is
        Open-Source-Software (<b>"OSS"</b>). You find a list of the applicable
        OSS licenses, related copyright notices and the source code under GitHub
        repository
        <a href="https://github.com/LeastAuthority/winden">
          https://github.com/LeastAuthority/winden
        </a>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        The provisions in these Terms shall not limit your rights under the
        applicable OSS licenses in any way.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Limitation of warranty</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        You agree with us that we do not assume any warranty
        (<i>Gewährleistung</i>) for or in relation to the Service. Any and all
        statutory warranty shall be excluded to the extent permissible under
        applicable law.
      </li>
      <li>
        For clarity but not as a limitation to the aforementioned exclusion of
        warranty, we point you to the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
            We do especially not warrant any particular form, functionality
            and/or availability of the Service, neither for Senders nor for
            Receivers;
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are a Sender, we especially do not warrant that the Service
            is fit for any purpose or any of your specific requirements, that
            the Service can be used uninterrupted, timely or error-free.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are a Receiver, we explicitly do not warrant that the content
            which you receive through the Service is complete, correct, lawful,
            error-free and/or virus-free.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Choice of law and jurisdiction</b>

    <ol>
      <li>
        These Terms and their interpretation and any non-contractual obligations
        in connection with it are subject to German substantive law. The UN
        Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall
        not apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        English language terms used in these Terms describe German legal
        concepts only and shall not be interpreted by reference to any meaning
        attributed to them in any jurisdiction other than Germany. Where a
        German term has been inserted in brackets and/or italics it alone (and
        not the English term to which relates) shall be authoritative for the
        purpose of the interpretation of the relevant term whenever it is used
        in these Terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes regarding rights and
        duties under this Agreement, including its validity shall be Berlin,
        Germany unless you agree to these Terms in your capacity as a natural
        person (and not on behalf of a legal entity). In the latter case, the
        place of jurisdiction shall be determined based on statutory law.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Severability</b>
    <br />
    Should one or more provisions of these Terms be or become invalid or
    unenforceable in whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity and
    enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms. In place of any
    Standard Terms of Business (<i>Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen</i>) which
    are invalid or not incorporated in the Terms the statutory provisions shall
    apply (§ 306 (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB)). In all other cases, we
    shall agree a valid provision to replace the invalid or unenforceable
    provision which reflects as closely as possible the original economic
    purpose, provided a supplementary interpretation of the Terms (<i
      >ergänzende Vertragsauslegung</i
    >) does not have precedence or is not possible.
  </li>
</ol>
